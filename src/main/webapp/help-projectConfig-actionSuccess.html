		Customize detection of successful requests.

	<p>
		The detection of request failure or success by the performance report generator defaults to considering the "success" field of requests records.
		For a given request type, this detection may be customized by considering the content of the "result" field, trying to match it against a given regular expression to characterize success.
		<br/>Regular expressions follow Java's <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html">java.util.regex.Pattern</a> format.
