		Identification of request families for measurements aggregation.
	</p>

	<p>
		On performance report generation, requests are classified and aggregated on the basis of a generated key, resulting from the concatenation of fields type and comment of request reports.
		To perform a smarter aggregation, a regular expression may be defined to represent a variety of such keys as a single family of request. Then an alias is given to identify this family of request.
		Doing so results in a more relevant aggregation and in a more readable report.
		<br/>Regular expressions follow Java's <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html">java.util.regex.Pattern</a> format.
