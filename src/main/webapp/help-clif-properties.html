	<p>Java system properties to set in the ant command that will launch the CLIF process</p>

	<p>Advice: set a single property per line, with usual syntax <i>property.name=value</i></p>

	<p><strong>Caution:</strong>
	these properties are defined only in the ant process, and they are not propagated to the CLIF process launched by ant.
	To set system properties in the CLIF Java process, set <strong>-D</strong><i>property.name=value</i> statements in the Java options section.
