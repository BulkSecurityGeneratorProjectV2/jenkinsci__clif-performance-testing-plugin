clif-jenkins-plugin
===================

Plug-in for integrating CLIF performance testing into the Jenkins continuous integration server.

This plug-in enables to run CLIF test plans from Jenkins and to get detailed performance test reports,	including response time statistics, graphs, and performance trends (see [clif.ow2.org](http://clif.ow2.org)).

**Notes**:
* at least one "CLIF server" runtime has to be installed along with this plug-in;
* test plans and scenarios shall be written with the main CLIF GUI (*aka* "CLIF console") before importing them as Jenkins jobs.
